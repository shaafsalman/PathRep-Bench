MICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: A-C: See final diagnosis. D: Sections of the bladder show an invasive transitional cell carcinoma broadly. extending through the muscularis propria and into the perivesical fat (D1-4) The. corresponding, subjacent inked radial margin is negative for tumor. No definite. lymphovascular space invasion is identified. The adjacent urothelium along the. left lateral wall shows mild to moderate urothelial dysplasia. No carcinoma in. situ (flat lesion identified). Sections of the prostate show a unilateral prostatic adenocarcinoma, comprised. of variably sized glands infiltrating the fibromuscular stroma. The tumor is. predominantly along the left distal prostate (D19-20). No invasion into the. capsule or periprostatic soft tissue is identified. A few areas of atypical glands. are also seen in the right prostatic lobe (D15, D18) Two K903 stains performed. show intermittent staining of basal cells around critical glands, supporting. diagnoses of high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and atypical basal cell. hyperplasia. The apical urethral and radial margins as well as bilateral seminal. vesicles and vasa deferentia are all free of tumor. E-S: See final microscopic-diagnosis.

Breast invasive carcinoma,6,"age & :-. urgical Pathology: CLINICAL HISTORY: Breast cancer, tumor was 3 x 2.5 x 2 cm. GROSS EXAMINATION: A. ""Left modified radical mastectomy"", received fresh. Submitted is a 2050. gram, 22 x 20 x 8 cm left mastectomy specimen with 10 x 10 x 2 cm axillary. tail. There is a 30 x 20 cm skin ellipse with a 1.5 cm nipple and 6 cm areola. A. sutured 10.5 cm linear incision is present over the lower inner quadrant. The margins are inked in blue. Sectioning reveals a 3 x 2 x 2 cm biopsy cavity. in the lower inner quadrant, 3 cm from the inferior margin, 2 cm from the. medial margin, 4.5 cm from the deep margin, 8 cm from the superior margin, and. more than 15 cm from the lateral margin. The biopsy cavity extends to within. 1. cm of the skin incision. Adjacent to the deep edge of the biopsy cavity is. a. 3 x 2 x 1 cm irregular mass of firm, tan-white tissue. The mass lies. approximately 3.5 cm from the deep surgical margin, 2 cm from the medial. margin, 3 cm from the inferior margin, 7.5 cm from the superior margin, and. greater than 15 cm from the lateral margin. In the upper inner quadrant,. 3.5 cm from the biopsy cavity, is a 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm well circumscribed. nodule of firm, pale pink-tan tissue. The nodule lies nearest the deep margin,. extending to within 2 cm of this margin.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in seven parts, each labeled with the. patient's name. 1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'lingular nodule'. It. consists of a lingular segment of the lung measuring 15 x 7 x 3.5. cm. The staple line measures 17 cm which is shaved and the bronchial. around inked blue. The pleura is gray pink and glistening and. mottled moderately with fine black streaks. Also noted is a precut. area on the pleura which reveals a sub pleural gray white firm. nodule, measuring 1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm located 2 cm from the staple line. margin. The remainder of the bronchial is pink red blotchy and. crepitant. No other nodule is grossly identified. Frozen section is. performed on the nodule and resubmitted for permanent section. Representative section of the specimen and entire nodule are. submitted. 2. Part two is labeled 'left lower lobe wedge'. It consists of one. piece of yellow-pink soft tissue measuring 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Entirely. submitted in one cassette. 3. Part three is received fresh, labeled 'margin of left lower lobe. wedge'. It consists of a stapled strip of light tan tissue. measuring 3.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The staple line is shaved and the soft. tissue is submitted. 4. Part four is labeled 'level #5 lymph node'. It consists of. multiple soft red-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm in. aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette. 5. Part five is labeled 'level #7 lymph node'. It consists of a 1.5. x 1 x 0.8 cm red-black lymph node. Entirely submitted in one. cassette. 6. Part six is labeled 'level #9 lymph node'. It consists of a 1.2. x 1 x 0.6 cm red-black lymph node. Entirely submitted in one. cassette. 7. Part seven is received fresh, labeled 'basilar segment left lower. lobe silk stitches on tumor location'. It consists of a segment of. lung measuring 20 x 14 x 4.5 cm. The bronchial margin measures 1.5. cm and the vascular margin measures 1 cm. The pleura is gray pink. glistening and mottled moderately with fine black streaks. There are. two staple lines measuring 8 cm and 5 cm in length. There is a. precut area on the pleura which is marked with a stitch. At this. area there is a grey tan firm mass, measuring 1.5 x 1 cm and located. 1.5 cm from the bronchial resection margin, and 0.4 cm from the. closest staple line which is shaved and the bronchial is inked. black. The mass is located on the mediastinal surface of the lung. The remaining of the bronchial is pink red blotchy and crepitant. No. other nodule is grossly identified. Representative sections of the. specimen and the entire mass area with adjacent tissue are. submitted.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. Lung, lingula: wedge resection (Frozen Section). - Adenocarcinoma with lepidic, acinar and solid patterns. Result reported by. 2. Lung, left lower lobe: wedge biopsy (Frozen Section). - Adenocarcinoma with acinar and micropapillary patterns. Result reported by. on. Intra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by. Intra-Operative Consultation #2 performed by. Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM 1: Integrated Oncology. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Specimen #: RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.34G>C) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Mutations in th vrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor recept. gene are reported to be associated with. differenti. ness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitr. The objective response rate among. patien. ing. itation ranges from 55 to 82%. 8-21 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain;. noni 11: most mutations in non-small-cell lung.

CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: M ex-smoker (120 pack-years) with a 1.6 cm RUL nodule, 3.7 cm LLL. ground-glass mass and a 1 cm lingular nodule. MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in seven parts, each labeled with the. patient's name. 1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'lingular nodule'. It. consists of a lingular segment of the lung measuring 15 x 7 x 3.5. cm. The staple line measures 17 cm which is shaved and the bronchial. around inked blue. The pleura is gray pink and glistening and. mottled moderately with fine black streaks. Also noted is a precut. area on the pleura which reveals a sub pleural gray white firm. nodule, measuring 1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm located 2 cm from the staple line. margin. The remainder of the bronchial is pink red blotchy and. crepitant. No other nodule is grossly identified. Frozen section is. performed on the nodule and resubmitted for permanent section. Representative section of the specimen and entire nodule are. submitted. 2. Part two is labeled 'left lower lobe wedge'. It consists of one. piece of yellow-pink soft tissue measuring 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Entirely. submitted in one cassette. 3. Part three is received fresh, labeled 'margin of left lower lobe. wedge'. It consists of a stapled strip of light tan tissue. measuring 3.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The staple line is shaved and the soft. tissue is submitted. 4. Part four is labeled 'level #5 lymph node'. It consists of. multiple soft red-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm in. aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette. 5. Part five is labeled 'level #7 lymph node'. It consists of a 1.5. x 1 x 0.8 cm red-black lymph node. Entirely submitted in one. cassette. 6. Part six is labeled 'level #9 lymph node'. It consists of a 1.2. x 1 x 0.6 cm red-black lymph node. Entirely submitted in one. cassette. 7. Part seven is received fresh, labeled 'basilar segment left lower. lobe silk stitches on tumor location'. It consists of a segment of. lung measuring 20 x 14 x 4.5 cm. The bronchial margin measures 1.5. cm and the vascular margin measures 1 cm. The pleura is gray pink. glistening and mottled moderately with fine black streaks. There are. two staple lines measuring 8 cm and 5 cm in length. There is a. precut area on the pleura which is marked with a stitch. At this. area there is a grey tan firm mass, measuring 1.5 x 1 cm and located. 1.5 cm from the bronchial resection margin, and 0.4 cm from the. closest staple line which is shaved and the bronchial is inked. black. The mass is located on the mediastinal surface of the lung. The remaining of the bronchial is pink red blotchy and crepitant. No. other nodule is grossly identified. Representative sections of the. specimen and the entire mass area with adjacent tissue are. submitted. SUMMARY OF SECTIONS: 1A frozen section of the nodule. 1B-1D remaining of the nodule. 1E random section of the lung parenchyma. 1F staple line margin. 2A in toto. 3A soft tissue submitted, shaved. 4A in toto. 5A in toto. 6A in toto. 7A bronchial margin, shaved. 7B vascular margin, shaved. 7C-7H mass from stitch area with overlying pleura. 7I-7L mass from stitch area after shaving the staple line. 7M anthracotic lymph node from the hilum. SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. Lung, lingula: wedge resection (Frozen Section). - Adenocarcinoma with lepidic, acinar and solid patterns. Result reported by. 2. Lung, left lower lobe: wedge biopsy (Frozen Section). - Adenocarcinoma with acinar and micropapillary patterns. Result reported by. on. Intra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by. Intra-Operative Consultation #2 performed by. Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM 1: Integrated Oncology. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Specimen #: RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.34G>C) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Collected Date: Received Date/TIme: D. The specimen consists of a pancreatoduodenectomy specimen, with the segment of distal antrum and duodenum. measuring 27.0 cm in length. There is a shallow indurated ulcerated area, 2.5 cm distal from the pyloric valve, measuring. 1.8 X 1.0 cm. This appears to lie 1.5 cm proximal to the area of the ampulla of Vater. This indurated ulcer appears to be in. continuity with an area tumorous induration in the attached head of pancreas. The head of pancreas measures 6.0 X 4.5 X. 3.0 cm. The uncinate margin and pancreatle neck margin are identified and painted orange and blue respectively. The. common bile duct can be Identified at the superior surface of the pancreas, and continuity cannot be traced through the. dense tumorous tissue in the head of pancreas.
