Pathology Report:
Left eye enucleation. Macroscopy. The eyeball measures 27 mm main line with a posterior segment of optic nerve of 7 mm. At. the section , the tumor seen measures 12 mm main line. A large number of samples have. been made for cryopreservation and cytogenetic studies. Microscopy. The cut end of the optic nerve as well as the optic nerve on his entire course including the. optic foramen are free of tumor. An uveal melanoma can be found, developed in the ciliary. processes. The tumor is nearly only made with fusiform cells organize in short little bundles,. separated by conjunctival vascular septum. The nuclear atypia are moderate. The nuclei are. ovoid with a small nucleolus. There are a few mitotic figures. Some of the cells are. pigmented. There is no visible endo lymphatic embolus. The tumor infiltrates the thickness of. the choroid but does not infiltrates the sclera. The anterior chamber is free. Conclusion. Melanoma of the choroid of the left eye, originating at the ciliary processes. Size of the tumor: 12 mm. Infiltration of the choroid. Sclera free of tumor , optic nerve on his entire course including the cut end free of tumor.</s>

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in seven parts, each labeled with the. patient's name. 1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'lingular nodule'. It. consists of a lingular segment of the lung measuring 15 x 7 x 3.5. cm. The staple line measures 17 cm which is shaved and the bronchial. around inked blue. The pleura is gray pink and glistening and. mottled moderately with fine black streaks. Also noted is a precut. area on the pleura which reveals a sub pleural gray white firm. nodule, measuring 1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm located 2 cm from the staple line. margin. The remainder of the bronchial is pink red blotchy and. crepitant. No other nodule is grossly identified. Frozen section is. performed on the nodule and resubmitted for permanent section. Representative section of the specimen and entire nodule are. submitted. 2. Part two is labeled 'left lower lobe wedge'. It consists of one. piece of yellow-pink soft tissue measuring 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Entirely. submitted in one cassette. 3. Part three is received fresh, labeled 'margin of left lower lobe. wedge'. It consists of a stapled strip of light tan tissue. measuring 3.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The staple line is shaved and the soft. tissue is submitted. 4. Part four is labeled 'level #5 lymph node'. It consists of. multiple soft red-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm in. aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette. 5. Part five is labeled 'level #7 lymph node'. It consists of a 1.5. x 1 x 0.8 cm red-black lymph node. Entirely submitted in one. cassette. 6. Part six is labeled 'level #9 lymph node'. It consists of a 1.2. x 1 x 0.6 cm red-black lymph node. Entirely submitted in one. cassette. 7. Part seven is received fresh, labeled 'basilar segment left lower. lobe silk stitches on tumor location'. It consists of a segment of. lung measuring 20 x 14 x 4.5 cm. The bronchial margin measures 1.5. cm and the vascular margin measures 1 cm. The pleura is gray pink. glistening and mottled moderately with fine black streaks. There are. two staple lines measuring 8 cm and 5 cm in length. There is a. precut area on the pleura which is marked with a stitch. At this. area there is a grey tan firm mass, measuring 1.5 x 1 cm and located. 1.5 cm from the bronchial resection margin, and 0.4 cm from the. closest staple line which is shaved and the bronchial is inked. black. The mass is located on the mediastinal surface of the lung. The remaining of the bronchial is pink red blotchy and crepitant. No. other nodule is grossly identified. Representative sections of the. specimen and the entire mass area with adjacent tissue are. submitted.

Intra-Operative Consultation #2 performed by. Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM 1: Integrated Oncology. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Specimen #: RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.34G>C) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received in seven parts, each labeled with the. patient's name. 1. Part one is received fresh, labeled 'lingular nodule'. It. consists of a lingular segment of the lung measuring 15 x 7 x 3.5. cm. The staple line measures 17 cm which is shaved and the bronchial. around inked blue. The pleura is gray pink and glistening and. mottled moderately with fine black streaks. Also noted is a precut. area on the pleura which reveals a sub pleural gray white firm. nodule, measuring 1 x 0.9 x 0.8 cm located 2 cm from the staple line. margin. The remainder of the bronchial is pink red blotchy and. crepitant. No other nodule is grossly identified. Frozen section is. performed on the nodule and resubmitted for permanent section. Representative section of the specimen and entire nodule are. submitted. 2. Part two is labeled 'left lower lobe wedge'. It consists of one. piece of yellow-pink soft tissue measuring 2 x 1 x 0.5 cm. Entirely. submitted in one cassette. 3. Part three is received fresh, labeled 'margin of left lower lobe. wedge'. It consists of a stapled strip of light tan tissue. measuring 3.5 x 0.4 x 0.3 cm. The staple line is shaved and the soft. tissue is submitted. 4. Part four is labeled 'level #5 lymph node'. It consists of. multiple soft red-black lymph nodes measuring 1.5 x 1.1 x 0.6 cm in. aggregate. Entirely submitted in one cassette. 5. Part five is labeled 'level #7 lymph node'.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. Lung, lingula: wedge resection (Frozen Section). - Adenocarcinoma with lepidic, acinar and solid patterns. Result reported by. 2. Lung, left lower lobe: wedge biopsy (Frozen Section). - Adenocarcinoma with acinar and micropapillary patterns. Result reported by. on. Intra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by. Intra-Operative Consultation #2 performed by. Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM 1: Integrated Oncology. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Specimen #: RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.34G>C) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

Addendum #1 performed by. ADDENDUM 2: EGFR Mutation Analysis. Specimen #: Clinical Data: Adenocarcinoma. RESULTS: No mutation detected. INTERPRETATION: No mutations were identified; in the sample. provided for analysis. Fewer than %5 of non-small-cell lung. carcinoma patients without identifiable mutations are reported to be. responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapies. COMMENT: Forty percent (40%) or more cellularity is optimal for. this mutation analysis. The sample submitted showed 50% tumor. cellularity upon pathologist review. A frequently occurring sequence change 2361G>A (Q787Q) was. identified. This polymorphism is known not to have clinical. significance. Mutations in th vrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth. factor recept. gene are reported to be associated with. differenti. ness or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase. inhibitr.

Right leg mass sarcoma; excision: - High grade spindle and pleomorphic sarcoma consistent with malignant. fibrous histiocytoma/ undifferentiated high grade pleomorphic sarcoma. - Tumor measures 9 x 6 x 4 cm. - Tumor involves dermis, subcutis and extends to fascia. Necrosis is present about 15%. - Tumor extends focally to the deep margin of resection and is located. 0.1 cm from the lateral resection margin (Please see part 2). Tumor does not. involve attached periosteum and portion of bone, All other margins are. negative. Note: Immunostains show that the tumor cells are negative for SMA, myogenin,. desmin, S-100 and HMB45. 2. Lateral fascial margin right leg: - Benign fibro-adipose tissue. Some of the immunohistochemistry and ISH tests were developed and their. performance characteristics were determined by the. They have not been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug. Administration. The FDA has determined that such clearance or approval is. not necessary. These tests are used for clinical purposes. They should not. be regarded as investigational or for research. This laboratory is certified. under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA - 88) as. qualified to perform high complexity clinical laboratory testing.

(Procedure: Laparoscopic hysterectomy,. bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy pelvic LND, (radical)). Gross Description. Part A: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's. name, medical record number and ""RADICAL HYSTERECTOMY, BSO"", and consists of. a radical hysterectomy and bilateral salpingooophorectomy. The specimen. includes a uterus (90.0 grams, 8.0 cm in length x 4.5 cm cornu to cornu, 3.0. cm anterior to posterior), with a attached cervix (3.5 x 3 cm) and bilateral. adnexa. The right fallopian tube (5.0 cm in length x 0.4 cm in. circumference) is attached to a right ovary (2.5 x 1.7 x 0.3 cm). The left. fallopian tube (6.5 cm in length x 0.4 cm in circumference) is attached to a. left ovary (2.5 x 1.5 x 0.4 cm) Additionally, the specimen has a right. parametrium measuring 2.5 x 0.7 x 0.5 and 3.5 x 1.5 x 0.5 cm, respectively. The vagina cuff is surrounding the cervix and measures 1.5 cm in length. The serosa is tan-pink, smooth and glistening with focal areas of adhesions. mostly at the lower posterior aspect. The anterior aspect is distorted by. the presence of an intramural nodule (2.0 x 1.8 cm). The cervix has an. eroded surface (3. x 3.5 cm) with areas of hemorrhage predominantly between. 3 and 6 o'clock. Peripherally to this area the cervix is partially covered. by a tan-pink, smooth and glistening mucosa extending into the vaginal cuff. The cervical os (0.8 cm in greatest dimension) is irregular and is. surrounded by hemorrhagic irregular surface. The cervical canal (3.0 in. length x 0.8 cm circumference) has a tan-pink herringbone mucosa and a focal. area of irregularity with papillary like projection closest to the cervical. os which is extending into the cervical canal up to 2.0 cm. The endometrial. cavity (3.2 x 0.5 cm) is covered by a tan-pink, hemorrhagic endometrial. mucosa (0.1 cm in thickness) The fundic area has a polypoid lesion (1.0 x. 0.3 x 0.2 cm). The myometrium (1.5 to 1.2 cm in thickness) is red-brown,. with fine tan-white fibrous septation. There is a tan-white nodular mass. with a whorling cut appearance in the fundic area. No other discrete lesions. are grossly identified. Both fallopian tubes have a fimbriated end and the serosa is tan-pink,. smooth and glistening with paratubal cysts varying in size from 0.1 to 0.3. cm in greatest dimension and filled with a yellow clear serous fluid. Cross sectioning demonstrates tan-pink mucosa with a pinpoint lumen. No. discrete lesions are grossly identified. Both ovaries have a tan-pink to tan-yellow cerebroid-like appearance of the. external surface. Arising from both external surfaces, there are cystic. lesions measuring on the right side 0.7 x 0.7 cm and on the left 0.7 x 0.5. cm. The cysts are filled with a hemorrhagic serous fluid. Additional cystic. lesions are grossly seen in the periphery of both ovaries varying from 0.3. to 0.5 cm in greatest dimension. Ink Code: Blue anterior aspect, surgical resection margin. Red posterior aspect, surgical resection margin. Orange- amputated margin (lower uterine segment and upper cervical canal).

A58: intramural leiomyoma. A59-A61: endometrium/myometrium, posterior aspect sequentially submitted. from upper to lower portion (A61 including the area closest to the cervical. canal). Part B: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's. name, medical record number and ""RIGHT PELVIC LYMPH NODE"" and consists of. multiple irregular yellow-brown fragments of fibroadipose tissue measuring. in aggregate 5.0 x 3.5 x 1.0 cm. There are four possible lymph nodes. varying in size from 0.5 cm in greatest dimension to 3.0 x 0.7 x 0.3 cm. Submitted in toto for permanent sections in cassettes B1-B4. Part C: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's. name, medical record number and ""LEFT PELVIC LYMPH NODE"" and consists of. multiple yellow-brown irregular fragments of fibroadipose tissue measuring. in aggregate 4.5 X 3.0 x 1.0 cm. Three possible lymph nodes are found. varying in size from 1.0 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm to 3.0 x 0.8 x 0.5 cm. The specimen. is submitted in toto for permanent sections in cassettes C1- C5. Part D: The specimen is received in formalin, labeled with the patient's. name, medical record number and ""ANTERIOR VAGINAL MARGIN"" and consists of an. irregular fragment of tan-brown tissue (2.2 x 1.4 x 0.3 cm). One surface. is. partially covered by a tan-brown irregular mucosa. The opposite surface is. irregular, red-brown with cautery artifact.

Collected Date: Received Date/TIme: D. The specimen consists of a pancreatoduodenectomy specimen, with the segment of distal antrum and duodenum. measuring 27.0 cm in length. There is a shallow indurated ulcerated area, 2.5 cm distal from the pyloric valve, measuring. 1.8 X 1.0 cm. This appears to lie 1.5 cm proximal to the area of the ampulla of Vater. This indurated ulcer appears to be in. continuity with an area tumorous induration in the attached head of pancreas. The head of pancreas measures 6.0 X 4.5 X. 3.0 cm. The uncinate margin and pancreatle neck margin are identified and painted orange and blue respectively. The. common bile duct can be Identified at the superior surface of the pancreas, and continuity cannot be traced through the. dense tumorous tissue in the head of pancreas. At the ampullary reglon, there is a nodular thickening lying beneath the. mucosa, measuring approximately 1.8 X 1,0 X 1.0 cm. Part of the common bile duct can be identified, but the exact orifice. is not clearly evident. Transverse sectioning of the head of pancreas reveals a firm craggy area beneath the area of. duodenal ulceration, this tumorous zone is ill-defined, but measures approximately 2.5 x 1.5 X 2.5 cm. It appears. to. extend. close to the uncinate margin and possibly extend into peripancreatic tissue in the upper pancreaticoduodenal area. The. ulcerated duodenal wall is obscured. Further sectioning reveals small firm lymph nodes in the vicinity of the common bile duct, the superior margin, and the. pancreas as well as in the pancreatoduodenal region. Sections are taken as follows: D1. Pancreatic neck margin. D2,D3. Two halves of the superior transverse section of pancreas. D4,D5. Two halves of next transverse section of pancreas. D6,D7. Two halves of transverse sections through mid zone of pancreas including uncinate. margin. D8. Additional sections of uncinate margin. D9,D10.

Furthermore, carcinoma shows. extension beyond the pancreas Into peripancreatic tissue predominantly at the superior margin of the pancreas and in the. zone. between pancreas and duodenum. Carcinoma also invades into and through muscularis propria of the duodenum. and ulcerates the overlying duodenal mucosa, Carcinoma also focally involves the uncinate margin, and there are areas. where carcinoma encroaches on the cauterized soft tissue margin at the superior and posterior pancreaticoduodenal. area. There is prominent perineural invasion, and the section taken of the proximal common bile duct margin includes. carcinoma with perineural growth at this resection odge. There is prominent lymphovascular invasion in areas, and there is metastatic carcinoma in four of eleven lymph nodes. The proximal gastric and distal duodenal margins are unremarkable.

Pathology Report:
Microscopic Discussion: Sections demonstrate a paraganglioma characterized by a proliferation of monotonous cells with round. nuclei and salt and pepper chromatin, prominent red nucleoli and esoinophilic cytoplasm. These cells. are arranged in small nests surrounded by a delicate capillary network. One mitotic figure per 10 high-. power fields is identified. Bands of fibroelastic tissue intersect the tumor cells. Few entrapped nerve. fibers are also seen. Necrosis is not identified. Diagnosis: Neck Tumor- Paraganglioma.</s>

The biopsy cavity extends to within. 1. cm of the skin incision. Adjacent to the deep edge of the biopsy cavity is. a. 3 x 2 x 1 cm irregular mass of firm, tan-white tissue. The mass lies. approximately 3.5 cm from the deep surgical margin, 2 cm from the medial. margin, 3 cm from the inferior margin, 7.5 cm from the superior margin, and. greater than 15 cm from the lateral margin. In the upper inner quadrant,. 3.5 cm from the biopsy cavity, is a 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm well circumscribed. nodule of firm, pale pink-tan tissue. The nodule lies nearest the deep margin,. extending to within 2 cm of this margin. In the lower outer quadrant are two. similar well-circumscribed nodules of pale pink-tan tissue: a 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.5. cm nodule and, 1.5 cm lateral to this, a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm nodule. The 1.1. x. 0.6 x 0.5 cm nodule lies 5 cm from the lateral surgical margin and 4 cm from. the inferior surgical margin. The 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm nodule is 3.5 cm from the. lateral surgical margin and 4 cm from the inferior surgical margin. Further. lateral and inferior within the lower outer quadrant is a small, 0.4 x 0.3 x. 0.2 cm, oblong mass of firm tan tissue, lying 2 cm from the deep and the. lateral surgical margins. In the upper outer quadrant there are small areas. of fibrosis, some associated with small cysts (up to 0.3 cm in diameter) . Within the axillary tail, thirty-two lymph node candidates, 0.5 to 2.2 cm in. greatest dimension, are identified: 8 within the proximal third (zone III),. 6. within the middle third (zone II), and 18 lymph nodes in the distal third.

FS1 (A) Uterus, ovaries, rectum, cervix, excision: Infiltrating ovarian carcinoma. associated with serous. cyst, infiltrating into colon; defer classification of carcinoma to permanent section. and. immunohistochemistry. Clinical History. The patient is a. vith a history of a pelvic mass, undergoing. resection of rectum and total. abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Gross Description. The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the patient's name and. medical record number. Parts A and C are received fresh, and Parts B, D-F are received in formalin. Part A is received fresh from the O.R., for frozen section, additionally labeled ""uterus,. cervix, ovaries,. rectum, and left ureter - FS,"" and consists of a composite resection specimen. including: uterus (5.5 cm. from superior to inferior, 5.0 cm cornu to cornu, and 3.5 cm anterior to posterior),. cervix (1.5cm X 1.0cm),. ovaries and fallopian tube, a segment of descending colon and rectum (23.0cm in. length X 3.0cm diameter). and an unattached segment of ureter (5.0cm in length X 0.3cm in diameter). Centered in the left adnexa is a 14.0 X 7.0 x 6.5 cm solid and cystic mass. The solid. portion (8.5 X 6.6 X 4.0. cm) is soft, pink-tan with areas of apparent necrosis, and comprises approximately. 40% of the mass. The. cystic portion of the mass is composed of multiple smooth walled cystic spaces. without excresences. No. residual ovary is identified in the mass. The solid portion infiltrates through the distal. portion of the. rectum with invasion through the rectal wall, ulceration of the mucosa, and. penetration into the lumen. The proximal and distal margins of the colon/rectum are free of tumor. Tumor. approaches to wthin 3.5cm. from the distal margin (rectum) and to within 10 cm of the proximal margin. (descending colon). The tumor. contains a cauterized surface near it's invasion into the rectum. The surgeon. indicates the separate. segment of left ureter was present adjacent to this cauterized area. Additionally,. tumor infiltrates into the. posterior wall of the uterus with invasion into but not through the myometrial wall. The uterine cavity. overlying the area of tumor invasion appears grossly unremarkable. The tumor does. not appear to involve. any other structures grossly. Two lymph nodes are found between the ovarian mass. and the rectum. Representative sections of the solid component of the mass and sections of tumor. infiltrating rectum are. submitted for frozen section diagnosis # 1 with the frozen remnants in cassettes A1-. A3. Additionally,. portions of the mass as well as uninvolved endomyometrium are submitted for. research. The uterus additionally shows multiple nodules, sub-mucosal and sub-serosal, with. firm, white-tan cut. surfaces showing a whorled appearance. These nodules range in size from 0.7 to. 2.2cm in maximal. diameter and do not appear to be associated with the adnexal mass. No areas of. hemorrhage, necrosis, or. cystic degeneration are identified in these nodules. The ectocervix (1.0 X 1.0 cm) has. a smooth white-tan. surface without focal lesions. The cervical os is fish-mouthed and measures 0.7 cm in. greatest dimension. The endocervix has glistening tan-brown mucosa and appears grossly unremarkable. The endometrium is. thin, tan-brown, and grossly appears atrophic. The right ovary is white-tan,. measures 2.5 X 1.5 X 0.8 cm. and shows no gross abnormalities. The right fallopian tube (4.5 cm length X 0.5 cm. diameter) appears. grossly unremarkable. The anatomic area of the left fallopian tube appears to consist. entirely of infiltrating. tumor and no residual fallopian tube is identified grossly. The separate portion of left. ureter is unoriented,. appears intact, and shows no evidence of involvement by tumor. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassettes A1-A3: Frozen section remnants. Cassette A4: Cervix, anterior and posterior. Cassette A5: Leiomyomata. Cassette A6: Endomyometrium. Cassette A7: Right ovary and right fallopian tube. Cassette A8: Two regional lymphnodes. Cassettes A9-A10: Cystic portion of mass. Cassettes A11-A12: Tumor near inked cyst wall.

Cassettes A37-39: Colon with left ovary. Cassettes 40-42: Left ovary. Part B is additionally labeled ""2 - left pelvic lymph node,"" and consists of two. unoriented, rubbery,. tan-brown, irregularly shaped tissue fragments, the larger measuring 3.0 x 1.5 X 1.0. cm and the smaller. measuring 2.0 X 1.0 X 1.0 cm. The specimen appears to consist of candidate nodes. with a small portion of. attached adipose tissue. The largest node measures 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. The largest node is. bisected and submitted in cassette B1. The remaining candidate nodes are submitted. in cassette B2. Part C is additionally labeled ""1 - myoma,"" and consists of one unoriented, firm,. white-tan, irregularly. shaped tissue fragment measuring 4.5 X 4.0 X 2.5 cm and weighing 26.9 gm. The. specimen is inked blue. Cross sectioning reveals white-tan tissue in a whorled pattern, consistent with. leiomyoma. No areas of. hemorrhage, necrosis or cystic degeneration are identified. Three representative. sections are submitted in. cassette C1. Part D is additionally labeled ""4 - right pelvic lymph node,"" and consists of three. unoriented, rubbery,. tan-brown, irregularly shaped tissue fragments, the largest measuring 2.5 X 2.0 X. 1.3 cm.

FS1 (A) Uterus, ovaries, rectum, cervix, excision: Infiltrating ovarian carcinoma. associated with serous. cyst, infiltrating into colon; defer classification of carcinoma to permanent section. and. immunohistochemistry. Clinical History. The patient is a. vith a history of a pelvic mass, undergoing. resection of rectum and total. abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Gross Description. The specimen is received in six parts, each labeled with the patient's name and. medical record number. Parts A and C are received fresh, and Parts B, D-F are received in formalin. Part A is received fresh from the O.R., for frozen section, additionally labeled ""uterus,. cervix, ovaries,. rectum, and left ureter - FS,"" and consists of a composite resection specimen. including: uterus (5.5 cm. from superior to inferior, 5.0 cm cornu to cornu, and 3.5 cm anterior to posterior),. cervix (1.5cm X 1.0cm),. ovaries and fallopian tube, a segment of descending colon and rectum (23.0cm in. length X 3.0cm diameter). and an unattached segment of ureter (5.0cm in length X 0.3cm in diameter). Centered in the left adnexa is a 14.0 X 7.0 x 6.5 cm solid and cystic mass. The solid. portion (8.5 X 6.6 X 4.0. cm) is soft, pink-tan with areas of apparent necrosis, and comprises approximately. 40% of the mass. The. cystic portion of the mass is composed of multiple smooth walled cystic spaces. without excresences. No. residual ovary is identified in the mass. The solid portion infiltrates through the distal. portion of the. rectum with invasion through the rectal wall, ulceration of the mucosa, and. penetration into the lumen. The proximal and distal margins of the colon/rectum are free of tumor. Tumor. approaches to wthin 3.5cm. from the distal margin (rectum) and to within 10 cm of the proximal margin. (descending colon). The tumor. contains a cauterized surface near it's invasion into the rectum. The surgeon. indicates the separate. segment of left ureter was present adjacent to this cauterized area. Additionally,. tumor infiltrates into the. posterior wall of the uterus with invasion into but not through the myometrial wall. The uterine cavity. overlying the area of tumor invasion appears grossly unremarkable. The tumor does. not appear to involve. any other structures grossly. Two lymph nodes are found between the ovarian mass. and the rectum. Representative sections of the solid component of the mass and sections of tumor. infiltrating rectum are. submitted for frozen section diagnosis # 1 with the frozen remnants in cassettes A1-. A3. Additionally,. portions of the mass as well as uninvolved endomyometrium are submitted for. research. The uterus additionally shows multiple nodules, sub-mucosal and sub-serosal, with. firm, white-tan cut. surfaces showing a whorled appearance. These nodules range in size from 0.7 to. 2.2cm in maximal. diameter and do not appear to be associated with the adnexal mass. No areas of. hemorrhage, necrosis, or. cystic degeneration are identified in these nodules. The ectocervix (1.0 X 1.0 cm) has. a smooth white-tan. surface without focal lesions. The cervical os is fish-mouthed and measures 0.7 cm in. greatest dimension. The endocervix has glistening tan-brown mucosa and appears grossly unremarkable. The endometrium is. thin, tan-brown, and grossly appears atrophic. The right ovary is white-tan,. measures 2.5 X 1.5 X 0.8 cm. and shows no gross abnormalities. The right fallopian tube (4.5 cm length X 0.5 cm. diameter) appears. grossly unremarkable. The anatomic area of the left fallopian tube appears to consist. entirely of infiltrating. tumor and no residual fallopian tube is identified grossly. The separate portion of left. ureter is unoriented,. appears intact, and shows no evidence of involvement by tumor. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassettes A1-A3: Frozen section remnants. Cassette A4: Cervix, anterior and posterior. Cassette A5: Leiomyomata. Cassette A6: Endomyometrium. Cassette A7: Right ovary and right fallopian tube. Cassette A8: Two regional lymphnodes. Cassettes A9-A10: Cystic portion of mass. Cassettes A11-A12: Tumor near inked cyst wall. Cassettes A13-A14: Distal colon margin, en face. Cassettes A15-A16: Proximal colon margin, en face. Cassettes A17-A18: Tumor infiltrating uterus. Cassettes A19-A20: Bowel with tumor and cauterized area (inked) and cyst wall;. inked margin in cassette. A20. Cassettes A21-A22: Cauterized inked margin and bowe). Cassettes A23-A27: Representative sections of tumor under ovarian cyst. Cassette A28: Large bowel tumor and margin (cauterized). Cassettes A29-A30: Representative sections of large bowel tumor. Cassette A31: Small colonic tumor. Cassettes A32-A33: Extra colonic nodule. Cassettes A34-A35: Representative sections of uninvolved bowel. Cassette A36: Either end of left ureter. Cassettes A37-39: Colon with left ovary. Cassettes 40-42: Left ovary. Part B is additionally labeled ""2 - left pelvic lymph node,"" and consists of two. unoriented, rubbery,. tan-brown, irregularly shaped tissue fragments, the larger measuring 3.0 x 1.5 X 1.0. cm and the smaller. measuring 2.0 X 1.0 X 1.0 cm. The specimen appears to consist of candidate nodes. with a small portion of. attached adipose tissue. The largest node measures 2.0 cm in greatest dimension. The largest node is. bisected and submitted in cassette B1. The remaining candidate nodes are submitted. in cassette B2. Part C is additionally labeled ""1 - myoma,"" and consists of one unoriented, firm,. white-tan, irregularly. shaped tissue fragment measuring 4.5 X 4.0 X 2.5 cm and weighing 26.9 gm. The. specimen is inked blue. Cross sectioning reveals white-tan tissue in a whorled pattern, consistent with. leiomyoma. No areas of. hemorrhage, necrosis or cystic degeneration are identified. Three representative. sections are submitted in. cassette C1. Part D is additionally labeled ""4 - right pelvic lymph node,"" and consists of three. unoriented, rubbery,. tan-brown, irregularly shaped tissue fragments, the largest measuring 2.5 X 2.0 X. 1.3 cm.
