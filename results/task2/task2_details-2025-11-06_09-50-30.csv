The bladder measures. 40mm SI x 35mm ML The prostate measures 30mm SI, 30mm ML x 21mm AP. Attached. fibrofatty tissue measures up to 120mm maximum dimension. No lymph nodes. identified. In the left lateral wall of the bladder there is an ulcerated area 20mm. Underlying this is a hard tumour extending into perivessicular fat, measuring. 25mm SI by approximately 25mm ML. The tumour extends for a depth of 22mm and. is. very close to the left lateral soft tissue circumferential resection margin. Elsewhere, on the right side of the urethral orifice is an area of mucosal. irregularity 15 x 12mm. MICROSCOPY. The tumour seen in the left lateral wall of the bladder is a sarcomatoid variant. of transistional cell carcinoma/high grade urothelial carcinoma. The tumour is. composed predominantly of high grade malignant spindle cells with no. heterologous elements evident. Superficially, the morphology of the tumour is. more reminiscent of a solid conventional high grade urothelial carcinoma and. there is some overlying carcinoma in situ from which the tumour appears to be. arising. There is no definite evidence of lymphovascular invasion. The tumour invades through the muscularis propria into the perivessicular fat.

Superficially, the morphology of the tumour is. more reminiscent of a solid conventional high grade urothelial carcinoma and. there is some overlying carcinoma in situ from which the tumour appears to be. arising. There is no definite evidence of lymphovascular invasion. The tumour invades through the muscularis propria into the perivessicular fat. (pT3) and is 2mm from the circumferential resection margin at its closest point. (block 3B). The macroscopically abnormal area near the bladder neck shows evidence of oedema. and increased vascularity associated with urothelial hyperplasia. There is some. patchy dysplasia in this area which just amounts to CIS in a few foci. The. prostatic urethra shows evidence of similar oedema and increased vascularity. associated with von Brunn's nests and hyperplasia but there is no evidence of. dysplasia and the prostatic resection margin is clear of neoplasia. The prostate, vas deferens and seminal vesicles show no significant abnormality. The left and right distal ureteric resection margins (specimens 1 and 2) show no. definite evidence of carcinoma in situ. SUMMARY. Cystoprostatectomy: Sarcomatoid variant of high grade urothelial carcinoma. (G3,pT3). 2mm clearance from left lateral circumferential resection margin. Adjacent carcinoma-in-situ.

Submitted is a 2050. gram, 22 x 20 x 8 cm left mastectomy specimen with 10 x 10 x 2 cm axillary. tail. There is a 30 x 20 cm skin ellipse with a 1.5 cm nipple and 6 cm areola. A. sutured 10.5 cm linear incision is present over the lower inner quadrant. The margins are inked in blue. Sectioning reveals a 3 x 2 x 2 cm biopsy cavity. in the lower inner quadrant, 3 cm from the inferior margin, 2 cm from the. medial margin, 4.5 cm from the deep margin, 8 cm from the superior margin, and. more than 15 cm from the lateral margin. The biopsy cavity extends to within. 1. cm of the skin incision. Adjacent to the deep edge of the biopsy cavity is. a. 3 x 2 x 1 cm irregular mass of firm, tan-white tissue. The mass lies. approximately 3.5 cm from the deep surgical margin, 2 cm from the medial. margin, 3 cm from the inferior margin, 7.5 cm from the superior margin, and. greater than 15 cm from the lateral margin. In the upper inner quadrant,. 3.5 cm from the biopsy cavity, is a 1.5 x 1.2 x 0.8 cm well circumscribed. nodule of firm, pale pink-tan tissue. The nodule lies nearest the deep margin,. extending to within 2 cm of this margin. In the lower outer quadrant are two. similar well-circumscribed nodules of pale pink-tan tissue: a 1.1 x 0.6 x 0.5. cm nodule and, 1.5 cm lateral to this, a 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm nodule. The 1.1. x. 0.6 x 0.5 cm nodule lies 5 cm from the lateral surgical margin and 4 cm from. the inferior surgical margin. The 0.6 x 0.5 x 0.2 cm nodule is 3.5 cm from the. lateral surgical margin and 4 cm from the inferior surgical margin. Further. lateral and inferior within the lower outer quadrant is a small, 0.4 x 0.3 x. 0.2 cm, oblong mass of firm tan tissue, lying 2 cm from the deep and the. lateral surgical margins. In the upper outer quadrant there are small areas. of fibrosis, some associated with small cysts (up to 0.3 cm in diameter) . Within the axillary tail, thirty-two lymph node candidates, 0.5 to 2.2 cm in. greatest dimension, are identified: 8 within the proximal third (zone III),. 6. within the middle third (zone II), and 18 lymph nodes in the distal third.

Tumor description: Well demarcated, centrally ulcerated with. peripherally raised firm white borders. Location of tumor: Supraglottis involving the bilateral false. cords and extending across the midline to the right and left. aryepiglottic fold. Tumor size: 3.9 cm superior to inferior X 3.8 cm right to left X. 1.6 cm in thickness. Extent of tumor: The tumor involves both right and left false. cords and the anterior commissure. It extends to the right and. left aryepiglottic folds and creeps up onto the epiglottis. The. vallecula is grossly unremarkable. The hyoid bone is present and. unremarkable. The horns of the thyroid cartilage are present and. grossly unremarkable. The true cords in the subglottic region. are unremarkable. The pyriform sinuses are unremarkable with the. exception of undermining tumor. Sectioning through the tumor reveals a solid white cut surface. with extension into the soft tissues of the epiglottis extending. anteriorly towards the vallecula (0.3 cm from the vallecula. margin (H4), extension to the underlying thyroid cartilage but. does no: appear to invade the thyroid cartilage, the anterior. neck muscles are freely movable over the tumor, bilaterally. The. tumor undermines the mucosa of the right and left aryepiglottic. folds. The subglottic region is grossly unremarkable. The hyoid. bone is intact and the tumor is freely movable over the hyoid. bone. Distance of tumor from surgical margins: The mucosa component of. the tumor comes within 0.9 cm of the right pyriform sinus. margin, 1.2 cm from the left pyriform sinus margin, 2.1 cm from. the anterior vallecular margin, 3.3 cm from the inferior. trachea ring margin, 0.2 cm from the blue inked right anterior. soft tissue margin, 0.3 cm from the black inked left anterior. soft tissue margin, and 0.4 cm from the green inked anterior. midline margin. Description of remainder of tissue: The subglottis is lined by. grossly unremarkable mucosa. The anterior strap muscles are. unremarkable. No thyroid gland is identified. Tissue submitted for special investigations: Tumor is given to. tissue procurement. Lymph nodes: Submitted separately. Digital photograph taken: Yes. Block Summary: Inking: right/blue, left/black, vallecula/yellow and anterior. midline/green. H1 - En face tracheal margin. H2 - Perpendicular sections of right aryepiglottic fold into. pyriform sinus. H3 - Perpendicular sections of left aryepiglottic fold into. pyriform sinus. H4 - Epiglottis and vallecula. H5 - Right glottis. H6 - Left glottis (contains thyroid cartilage). H7 - Anterior commissure. H8 - Perpendicular sections of green inked anterior midline,. black inked left, blue inked right strap muscle margin. H9 - Remainder of right superior mucosal margin, en face.

It consists of a single. irregular partial kidney resection with attached perinephric fat, weighing 297 gm and measuring 28 x 9. x 5 cm. The kidney segment measures 8 x 5 x 4.5 cm. There are two tumors present in the specimen. Tumor #1 measures 5 x 3.5 x 4 cm and is gold, friable, irregular, and hemorrhagic. Tumor #2. measures 2.2 x 2 x 1.6 cm and is yellow, solid, and abuts tumor #1. The tumors appear grossly. encapsulated with a thin shell of kidney parenchyma attached. There is one area of possible partial. disruption of the capsule near the kidney parenchyma for tumor #1. An adrenal gland is identified,. which is orange-tan and measures 4.5 x 3.4 x 1.2 cm. There is no gross involvement of the tumor with. the adrenal gland, and it is roughly 1.3 cm away from the gland. There is no sinus or hilus found in the. specimen. The renal parenchyma resection margin is inked black, and the perinephric margin is inked. blue. No candidate lymph nodes are identified. A portion of tumor #2 is taken for tissue banking. Representative sections are submitted as follows: Cassette A1: Tumor #1, relationship to kidney parenchyma. Cassettes A2-A4: Tumor #1, relationship to perinephric fat margin.

It consists of a segment of. lung measuring 20 x 14 x 4.5 cm. The bronchial margin measures 1.5. cm and the vascular margin measures 1 cm. The pleura is gray pink. glistening and mottled moderately with fine black streaks. There are. two staple lines measuring 8 cm and 5 cm in length. There is a. precut area on the pleura which is marked with a stitch. At this. area there is a grey tan firm mass, measuring 1.5 x 1 cm and located. 1.5 cm from the bronchial resection margin, and 0.4 cm from the. closest staple line which is shaved and the bronchial is inked. black. The mass is located on the mediastinal surface of the lung. The remaining of the bronchial is pink red blotchy and crepitant. No. other nodule is grossly identified.

Intra-Operative Consultation #2 performed by. Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM 1: Integrated Oncology. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Specimen #: RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.34G>C) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

SPECIAL PROCEDURES: INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. Lung, lingula: wedge resection (Frozen Section). - Adenocarcinoma with lepidic, acinar and solid patterns. Result reported by. 2. Lung, left lower lobe: wedge biopsy (Frozen Section). - Adenocarcinoma with acinar and micropapillary patterns. Result reported by. on. Intra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by. Intra-Operative Consultation #2 performed by. Final Diagnosis performed by. ADDENDUM 1: Integrated Oncology. MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY. KRAS MUTATION ANALYSIS. Specimen #: RESULTS: Positive for a p.G12A (c.34G>C) mutation in codon 12 of. the KRAS gene. INTERPRETATION: Mutations in the KRAS gene are reported to. correlate with poor prognosis and resistance to tyrosine kinase. inhibitor therapies in patients with non-small lung cancer. COMMENT: KRAS mutations occur in 15-30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). patients and are strongly associated with adenocarcinoma and smoking. history. This assay analyzes codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 of the KRAS gene;. based on the current literature, approximately 98% of mutations are. expected to occur in these codons. The analytical sensitivity of. the assay is approximately 10%; thus mutations present in a low. percentage of cells may not be detected. This test is validated for use in identifying KRAS codon 12 and. codon 13 mutations in fresh, frozen, or formalin-fixed paraffin. embedded tissue. In particular the test performance has been. established in samples of colorectal cancer and non-small cell lung. carcinoma which harbor these mutations, although several other. tissues are also known to harbor KRAS mutations (e.g. tumors of. pancreas, bile duct, ovary, appendix, etc.). METHOD/LIMITATION: Tissue sections are reviewed by a pathologist and relevant tumor is. selected for analysis. DNA is isolated from the sample, quantified. and amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers to. exon 2 of the KRAS gene. PCR products are subjected to single. nucleotide primer extension to detect mutations at codons 12 and 13;. primer extension products are analyzed using capillary gel. electrophoresis and fluorescence detection. False positive or. negative results may occur for reasons that include genetic variants. or somatic heterogeneity of the tissue sample. REFERENCES: NSCLC. Mascaux C, Iannino N, et al.

The tumor is TTF1 positive and shows histologic similarity. to the patient's prior left upper lobe carcinoma. This. case has been reviewed at the intradepartmental daily consensus. meeting. CLINICAL HISTORY AND PRE - OPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS: Lung nodule right, R/O carcinoma. MACROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION: The specimen is received fresh in two parts, each labeled with the. patient's name. 1. Part one is labeled 'pulmonary nodule. It consists of a 4 X 3 X. 1.5 cm wedge resection of lung. The pleural surface is smooth tan. red and glistening. It has been previously incised to reveal a 1.1. X 0.8 X 0.7 cm tan white fairly well circumscribed firm mass, 0.3 cm. from the stapled margin. The pleural surface in the area of the. tumor is inked blue. The pleura near the stapled margin is inked. black. Representative section is taken and submitted for frozen. section. After frozen section the specimen is entirely submitted. 2. Part two is labeled 'sixth rib.' It consists of a 10.5 X 2.0 X. 0.6 cm segment of rib. The specimen is serially sectioned to reveal. no gross lesions. Representative sections are submitted after. decalcification. SUMMARY OF SECTIONS: 1A frozen section control. 1B rest of tumor. 1C stapled margin. 1D-H remainder of specimen. 2A-B representative. SPECIAL PROCEDURES: TTF1, elastic. INTRA - OPERATIVE CONSULTATION: 1. Pulmonary nodule; frozen section. Adenocarcinoma. Results reported. Intra-Operative Consultation #1 performed by.

Lung squamous cell carcinoma,2,"HISTORY. No details received. MACROSCOPIC. Two specimens received. 1: The specimen is labelled ""right upper lobe"" and consists of an upper lobe measuring 150 x 85 x 50. mm in the fresh state. 15 mm lateral to the bronchial resection margin and hilum, there is a nodular,. firm subpleural mass measuring 20 mm in diameter. On sectioning, the mass is pale, fleshy and. measures 27 mm in diameter. It underlies a proximal bronchus but is well clear of the bronchial. resection margins. [Sections taken; bronchial resection margin and hilar and peribronchial lymph. nodes, 1A; tumour with overlying pleura, 1B-1D; section of uninvolved lung, 1E]. 2: The specimen is labelled ""hilar lymph node"" and consists of two pieces of blackened lymph node,. each measuring 14 and 8 mm in maximal dimensions. The largest piece is bisected. [Wrapped and. blocked in toto, 2A]. MICROSCOPY. 1: Sections show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The tumour shows areas of clear. cell change. The lesion is subpleural but definite pleural invasion is not identified. Special stains will. be performed to assess this. The tumour is also in the region of a bronchus. In this area there appears. to be an in situ component. There is focal blood vessel invasion but no lymphatic permeation is seen. Perineural permeation is identified. The lesion is well clear of the bronchial resection margin. No. lymph node metastases are seen. The adjacent lung shows evidence of emphysema. 2: A deposit of poorly differentiated carcinoma is present within the lymph node cortex. SUMMARY. Right upper lobe and hilar lymph nodes: 1: Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma; 27 mm in maximal dimension. 2: Blood vessel and perineural invasion present but no lymphatic permeation seen. 3: No definite pleural invasion identified; clear of bronchial margin. 4: Hilar lymph node metastases. 5: T1N1MX. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT. Focal neuroendocrine positivity is identified within the tumour with chromogranin, synaptophysin and. CD 56. The positive areas appear to be in the better differentiated squamous areas. Therefore the. tumour is a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma showing focal neuroendocrine. differentiation.

Collected Date: Received Date/TIme: D. The specimen consists of a pancreatoduodenectomy specimen, with the segment of distal antrum and duodenum. measuring 27.0 cm in length. There is a shallow indurated ulcerated area, 2.5 cm distal from the pyloric valve, measuring. 1.8 X 1.0 cm. This appears to lie 1.5 cm proximal to the area of the ampulla of Vater. This indurated ulcer appears to be in. continuity with an area tumorous induration in the attached head of pancreas. The head of pancreas measures 6.0 X 4.5 X. 3.0 cm. The uncinate margin and pancreatle neck margin are identified and painted orange and blue respectively. The. common bile duct can be Identified at the superior surface of the pancreas, and continuity cannot be traced through the. dense tumorous tissue in the head of pancreas. At the ampullary reglon, there is a nodular thickening lying beneath the. mucosa, measuring approximately 1.8 X 1,0 X 1.0 cm. Part of the common bile duct can be identified, but the exact orifice. is not clearly evident. Transverse sectioning of the head of pancreas reveals a firm craggy area beneath the area of. duodenal ulceration, this tumorous zone is ill-defined, but measures approximately 2.5 x 1.5 X 2.5 cm. It appears. to. extend. close to the uncinate margin and possibly extend into peripancreatic tissue in the upper pancreaticoduodenal area. The. ulcerated duodenal wall is obscured. Further sectioning reveals small firm lymph nodes in the vicinity of the common bile duct, the superior margin, and the. pancreas as well as in the pancreatoduodenal region. Sections are taken as follows: D1. Pancreatic neck margin. D2,D3. Two halves of the superior transverse section of pancreas. D4,D5. Two halves of next transverse section of pancreas. D6,D7.

The gallbladder shows chronic inflammation with mild irregularity of mucosal architecture. No cytologic atypia Is. present. B. Sections after routine processing confirm the frozen section diagnosis. Only a small segment of bile duct tissue is. present. The surface epithelium is partly denuded but residual epithellum shows no significant atypla and there is no. malignancy in this fragment. C. Sections after routine processing confirm the frozen section diagnosis. D. There is a widespread invasive pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma that shows a varied morphology, ranging from well-. defined angulated ductal structures through to areas where more solid sheets and small nodules and single cells with. prominent nuclear pleomorphism can be seen. The carcinoma erodes the common bile duct and focal areas on ductal. dyplasia are evident. Carcinoma is present in practically all of the sections taken. The extent of carcinoma thus exceeds. the extent of gross induration and It is estimated to have a size of at least 6,0 cm. Furthermore, carcinoma shows. extension beyond the pancreas Into peripancreatic tissue predominantly at the superior margin of the pancreas and in the. zone. between pancreas and duodenum. Carcinoma also invades into and through muscularis propria of the duodenum. and ulcerates the overlying duodenal mucosa, Carcinoma also focally involves the uncinate margin, and there are areas. where carcinoma encroaches on the cauterized soft tissue margin at the superior and posterior pancreaticoduodenal. area. There is prominent perineural invasion, and the section taken of the proximal common bile duct margin includes. carcinoma with perineural growth at this resection odge. There is prominent lymphovascular invasion in areas, and there is metastatic carcinoma in four of eleven lymph nodes. The proximal gastric and distal duodenal margins are unremarkable.

Pancreatic adenocarcinoma,3,"Gross Description: Whipple, FS: Received is a Whipple specimen consisting of duodenum and pancreas. The duodenum measures 19 cm in length X 2.5-3.5 cm in diameter. Both ends are stapled closed. The. serosa is smooth, tan-pink, and the stapled margins are inked black. The duodenum is opened and. reveals a stent in the ampulla and a 1.5 X 1-cm area of flattened mucosa with underlying palpable,. indurated mass 3 cm proximal to the ampulla. The proximal duodenal margin is removed entirely en. face and used for frozen section diagnosis and is resubmitted in toto. The pancreas measures 5.8 X 4 x 4. cm. The neck margin is inked blue, and the radial margin is inked black. On sectioning, a 4 X 3.8 x 3-cm,. ill-defined, indurated, white-yellow mass with clear tan, mucinous filled cystic spaces is identified in the. head of the pancreas, 0.6 cm to the neck. margin, approximately 0.2 the ampulla, and focally abuts the Adenocareenina, deatnos. cm to. black-inked radial margin, and grossly extends to the proximal duodenal Site Vancreas head. margin. The ill-defined mass surrounds the main pancreatic and common bile ducts;. however, both ducts are probe patent through the ampulla. The common bile. duct contains a blue stent. The ducts appear to enter the duodenum via. adjacent but separate ductal ampullae. Common bile duct at the margin is. dilated at 1 cm in diameter. The main pancreatic duct at the neck margin. is dilated up to 0.6 cm in diameter. Sectioning through the mass into the duodenum proximal to the ampulla. reveals the mass to extend grossly into the muscularis of the duodenum and. a clear, mucinous, fluid-filled space, 1.4 cm in greatest dimension,. subjacent to the flattened duodenal mucosal area. Sectioning and palpation of the peripancreatic fat reveals 14 possible. lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 cm in greatest dimension up to 1.2 cm. in greatest dimension. Additionally noted is a 4.2 X 3.2 X 0.6-cm, lymph. node versus splenule. All possible lymphoid tissue is submitted. Representative sections of the largest lymph node versus splenule are. submitted. Representative sections are submitted.

Gross Description: Whipple, FS: Received is a Whipple specimen consisting of duodenum and pancreas. The duodenum measures 19 cm in length X 2.5-3.5 cm in diameter. Both ends are stapled closed. The. serosa is smooth, tan-pink, and the stapled margins are inked black. The duodenum is opened and. reveals a stent in the ampulla and a 1.5 X 1-cm area of flattened mucosa with underlying palpable,. indurated mass 3 cm proximal to the ampulla. The proximal duodenal margin is removed entirely en. face and used for frozen section diagnosis and is resubmitted in toto. The pancreas measures 5.8 X 4 x 4. cm. The neck margin is inked blue, and the radial margin is inked black. On sectioning, a 4 X 3.8 x 3-cm,. ill-defined, indurated, white-yellow mass with clear tan, mucinous filled cystic spaces is identified in the. head of the pancreas, 0.6 cm to the neck. margin, approximately 0.2 the ampulla, and focally abuts the Adenocareenina, deatnos. cm to. black-inked radial margin, and grossly extends to the proximal duodenal Site Vancreas head. margin. The ill-defined mass surrounds the main pancreatic and common bile ducts;. however, both ducts are probe patent through the ampulla. The common bile. duct contains a blue stent. The ducts appear to enter the duodenum via. adjacent but separate ductal ampullae. Common bile duct at the margin is. dilated at 1 cm in diameter. The main pancreatic duct at the neck margin. is dilated up to 0.6 cm in diameter. Sectioning through the mass into the duodenum proximal to the ampulla. reveals the mass to extend grossly into the muscularis of the duodenum and. a clear, mucinous, fluid-filled space, 1.4 cm in greatest dimension,. subjacent to the flattened duodenal mucosal area. Sectioning and palpation of the peripancreatic fat reveals 14 possible. lymph nodes ranging in size from 0.3 cm in greatest dimension up to 1.2 cm. in greatest dimension. Additionally noted is a 4.2 X 3.2 X 0.6-cm, lymph. node versus splenule. All possible lymphoid tissue is submitted. Representative sections of the largest lymph node versus splenule are. submitted.

Options:
(A) Stage I
(B) Stage II
(C) Stage III
(D) Stage IV

Pathology Report:
Left eye enucleation. Macroscopy. The eyeball measures 27 mm main line with a posterior segment of optic nerve of 7 mm. At. the section , the tumor seen measures 12 mm main line. A large number of samples have. been made for cryopreservation and cytogenetic studies. Microscopy. The cut end of the optic nerve as well as the optic nerve on his entire course including the. optic foramen are free of tumor. An uveal melanoma can be found, developed in the ciliary. processes. The tumor is nearly only made with fusiform cells organize in short little bundles,. separated by conjunctival vascular septum. The nuclear atypia are moderate. The nuclei are. ovoid with a small nucleolus. There are a few mitotic figures. Some of the cells are. pigmented. There is no visible endo lymphatic embolus. The tumor infiltrates the thickness of. the choroid but does not infiltrates the sclera. The anterior chamber is free. Conclusion. Melanoma of the choroid of the left eye, originating at the ciliary processes. Size of the tumor: 12 mm. Infiltration of the choroid. Sclera free of tumor , optic nerve on his entire course including the cut end free of tumor.
